*Every* person who visits ICT is expected to follow these rules. Breaking them will result in message deletions, timeouts, and in severe or repeat cases, bans. We don't like people being banned or timed out - we really don't. But, for the integrity of this community, some rules have to be made and for fairness to all they must be followed. If you don't agree, that's cool, but you shouldn't participate if you feel you cannot follow them.

**These rules apply across all facets of ICT - Stream, Discord, or public event.**

## Don't be a dick  
This means be respectful to each other. This is repeated in the "Follow the Golden Rule" rule. Be kind to each other. You're all human beings and you can poke fun at one another or the streamer (yes, Tim's a person too) without being mean about it.
* Absolutely NO rape jokes or edgelord memes. They're not funny and wholly unappreciated.  
* *DO NOT* argue with mods or the streamer. Their word is final, and if you have an issue, please take it up in DMs on Discord, not in public forums.

## NO religion/politics  
This is one that constantly has to be enforce. Leave the politics or religious discussion to whispers with others or discussion in Discord DMs. It has no place in ICT public view, period. If a game has politics, you can discuss politics in context of the game, but politics has torn tight-knit families apart. We've seen what it can do to a community our size. This also applies to memes, jokes, and even naming yourself in Quiplash. Just don't.

## Follow the Golden Rule  
"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you." Be nice to each other. It's not hard. If you don't like someone, don't interact with them! It's as simple as that.

## No spoilers  
This means do not post important plot points, twists, or endings to any media (TV show, book, movie, or video game) that's released in the last 6 months. Some people may not have had a chance to experience it yet due to choice or inability to, so don't ruin it for them. If you want to discuss something recent, take it to whispers, DMs or voice chat.

## Don't be a bigot  
This one's a tough one since there's a lot of stuff people don't seem to realize are bigotry out there, and that's okay. We're all learning and growing. This means no racism, homophobia, transphobia, religion bashing, or ableism. Blatant violations of this (slurs, etc) are an instant ban. I don't care how you view any of these things, hatred has NO PLACE at Insert Coin Theater.

## Have fun and make friends  
Let's just have a good time. That's the whole purpose of this community. Connect, play games together, and enjoy each other.
