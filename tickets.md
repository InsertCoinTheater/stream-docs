## Challenge Prize Rules  
Tim will make an effort to defeat the challenge you set forth, as long as it's reasonable.

***REASONABLE*** is defined as something that could be accomplished by a regular gamer with some effort. It must be set within the game that is being played at the time.

If no time limit is set (such as "in one round") Tim will try to accomplish it in 10 minutes.

All challenges subject to veto by Tim.

## Game Prize Rules  
Games selected by viewers must be owned by Tim (or gifted to him).

He will play for a minimum of 15 minutes, more if he's liking it.

It will be played during the next stream where the schedule is flexible (non-promotional times).

The game must be allowed by TOS and can be vetoed by Tim for any reason.
