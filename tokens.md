If you only get one item out of a box, you'll gain a bonus 20% to your base roll. This means that the minimum you can get is a 21% and the max you can get is 120%, which cuts the chance of an <span style='color: gray; font-weight: bold;'>Average</span> item by &#8531;, increasing your chance to get <span style='color: green; font-weight: bold;'>Good</span> or better items!

## Trophies
Trophies are a special collectible that, as of 4/10/2018, has no real value. However, if you come across a duplicate, it will be converted into Tickets and worth a higher value than what you could normally get from the same tier of rarity.
