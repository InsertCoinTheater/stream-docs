<h1>Tokens</h1>
Tokens are the primary currency of Insert Coin Theater. Tokens are earned by watching the stream, with bonuses being given for being engaged in chat, becoming a regular (15 hours or more of view time), or being a subscriber!

Tokens are awarded every 20 minutes.

You can check your Tokens at any time by using **!tokens** in chat.

## Uses for Tokens  
### Games  
There are a variety of mini-games in which you can participate in the Arcade. The table below details the games and the commands to activate or participate in them.

| Game | Description | Command |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------ |
| Claw Game | Test your "skill" with the Claw Game to try to get a bonus of tokens over top of what you put into the machine!  | !claw &lt;tokens amount&gt; |
| Laser Tag | Battle against an NPC group of Laser Tag combatants to try to earn a Token bonus over what you bet! | !lasertag &lt;tokens amount&gt; |
| DDR Tournament | Play some Dance Dance Revolution against other viewers to win the gambled prize pool of tokens. | !ddr &lt;tokens amount&gt; |

### Open Jukebox  
On occasion, Tim will open up the Jukebox to non-subscribers. When live, it costs 200 Tokens to request a song that will be played on-stream.

**NOTE:** Requesting offensive songs or songs with slurs (the "N" word) can result in a timeout or ban in accordance with the [Rules](rules.md). Keep it classy.

## Lootboxes  
Lootboxes are randomized prize packages. For each Lootbox redeemed, you will get 1-3 prizes containing a combination of the following:

* Tickets
* Tokens
* Steam Game Code Giveaways
* Instant Beanboozled Bean Challenges

A Lootbox costs **2000 Tokens** to redeem. You can redeem it using **!lootbox** in chat.

Once you redeem a Lootbox, the prizes must be [Claimed](#claiming-lootbox-prizes) using **!claim**.

### Claiming Lootbox Prizes  
Once a Lootbox has been redeemed, you should receive a response whisper containing a list of the prizes you win. The prizes will also appear on-stream.

For Ticket and Token prizes, you will need to use **!claim** to claim the prizes and add them to your account. For Giveaway and Bean prizes, they will be redeemed as soon as possible by Tim.

### Free Lootboxes  
Every **18 hours**, subscribers to Insert Coin Theater receive one free Lootbox, redeemed with the appropriate button on the Interactive board.

### Lootbox Prize List
This is as current as I can keep it and is liable to change as time goes on.

If you only get one item out of a box, you'll gain a bonus 20% to your base roll. This means that the minimum you can get is a 21% and the max you can get is 120%, which cuts the chance of an <span style='color: gray; font-weight: bold;'>Average</span> item by half, increasing your chance to get <span style='color: green; font-weight: bold;'>Good</span> or better!
