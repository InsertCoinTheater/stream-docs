On occasion, Tim will open up the Jukebox to non-subscribers. When live, it costs 200 Tokens to request a song that will be played on-stream.

**NOTE:** Requesting offensive songs or songs with slurs (the "N" word) can result in a timeout or ban in accordance with the [Rules](rules.md). Keep it classy.
